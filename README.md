# video-comment

A new way of commenting on videos, aimed for lectures. Teachers can upload lectures (videos), and students can post comment at a specific video seeking time. The comment can even contain a recorded video of the user using the webcam.


As the video seeks to the time of the comment, the video pauses and the comment pops up. In case of lectures, students can then point out what part they exactly have a problem in by posting the video at that very time.
